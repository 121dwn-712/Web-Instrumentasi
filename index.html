                <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing computer systems capable of learning from data and experience without being explicitly programmed. In machine learning, algorithms are used to analyze patterns in datasets, make predictions or decisions based on that data, and continuously improve accuracy as more data becomes available. This technology is widely applied in various fields, such as image recognition, natural language processing, product recommendations, fraud detection, and many others.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Computer programming is the process of creating instructions that computers can understand and execute to perform specific tasks. In computer programming, programmers use programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript to write code that determines how software or applications should function. This code consists of a series of logical commands that enable computers to process data, perform calculations, and produce the desired output. Computer programming is used in various fields, ranging from application development, database management, task automation, to the development of artificial intelligence systems such as machine learning.</p>
